## ICMP (INTERNET CONTROL MESSAGE PROTOCOL)
- Concept: ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used for error reporting and diagnostics. Tools like ping and traceroute rely on it.
- Analogy: Think of ICMP like a postal service “delivery receipt” – it tells you if your letter (packet) reached the destination or not.
- Packet Tracer Lab:
	- Place 2 PCs in Packet Tracer.
	- Connect them with a switch.
    - Assign IP addresses (e.g., PC1: 192.168.1.1, PC2: 192.168.1.2).
  	- Use the ping command from PC1 to PC2.
  	- Observe ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply.

- Key Takeaway: ICMP doesn’t carry data—it just reports on the status of IP communication.
	- ICMP is essential for troubleshooting — it helps you know if devices are reachable.
	- Ping uses ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply.
	- ICMP doesn’t carry user data, just control messages.
	- You can simulate ICMP easily in Packet Tracer with basic topology.
